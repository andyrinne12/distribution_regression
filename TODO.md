Project Description

<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

### Todo

- [ ] Check how large variances/mean affect mean encoddings  
- [ ] Find GP hyperparameters for fixed sigma threshold on normals  
- [ ] Try to classify on sigma threshold using polynomial encoding  
- [ ] Fit GP to classify normals vs uniforms with same mean/var  
- [ ] Fit GP to classify bormals vs uniforms with arbitrary mean/var  

### In Progress

- [ ] Find GP hyperparameters for line/curve sigma threshold on normals
